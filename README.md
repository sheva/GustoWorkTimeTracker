# Gusto Work Time Tracker

Being a contractor at the end of every other working week I have to log my working time into system called Gusto (https://gusto.com). As well I have to send Excel time table to my manager. So have automated this job. I only add new style sheet into Excel file and populate data from it into Gusto time tracking system.
